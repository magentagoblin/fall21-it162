    <!-- <h2 class="pageID">Welcome</h2> -->
    
    <p>I'm a 22 year old human and live in Seattle, WA with my cat, Panda. I've been out of work during the pandemic, but before I worked odd jobs including working at a thrift store, as a dishwasher, a barista, and even in shipping/packaging once. Despite the thrill of styrofome packing peanuts, I am excited for the prospect of future jobs that involve web design!</p>

    <p>I'm still very new to web development. This past Summer quarter was my introduction to web design where I went from knowing no HTML or CSS, to creating a whole website for my friend's band by the end. (If you'd like to see screenshots of that site's homepage, click <a href="images/bl-screenshot1.png" target="_blank">here!</a>) I really enjoy the creative possiblities that come with web and software development, and I'm very excited to continue my learning.</p>
